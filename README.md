# Exercise Tracker Web App

### Overview
This web app is designed as a way for individuals to keep track of their own workouts - date performed, type of exercise, etc. All workouts are saved in a database attached to the backend of the program, and can be edited or deleted at a later time.

### How to Use
On the home page you can view, edit, and delete past workouts. There is also an option to add a new workout, and upon being added will return to the home page automatically.
